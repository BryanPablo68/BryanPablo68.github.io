            About Me
        </h1>
        <h4>I live in Oakland, California. I used to live In L.A but I moved here in 1st grade. My parents are both from Guatemala and I like the culture there.
        <p> My favorite subjects in school is P.E and Geometery. I like Geometery because the teacher makes it really interesting. I also like P.E because I can play sports with friends. My goal is to get a 4.0 or higher for the rest of highschool to get in a good college.</p></h4>
